<sub>_(Ctrl + Click or Middle-click to open in a new tab)_</sub>

This repository showcases **LinkedIn Flow**, an iterative design project focused on re-imagining the **LinkedIn news feed** through a pure HTML and CSS implementation. Born from a desire to address current UI/UX challenges, this project aims to provide a clearer, more cohesive, and visually organized Browse experience for professionals.

## Project Overview
**LinkedIn Flow** tackles common user interface pain points identified in the existing LinkedIn news feed, such as scattered information hierarchy, excessive whitespace, and a perceived disconnect between key sections (e.g., user profile information).

Leveraging 
**Gestalt's Law of Proximity**, this initial phase of the project focuses on:
* **Unifying user profile data** into intuitive, self-contained design blocks.
* **Improving information architecture** to enhance content association and readability.
* **Optimizing visual space** to create a less cluttered and more logical layout.

This project is conceived as an **iterative design journey**, starting with a robust HTML and CSS foundation. Future iterations will explore migrations to other front-end technologies to further refine the user experience and expand functionality.
